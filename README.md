# UFOs

## Overview
We provided to Dana a working basic webpage that allows users to analyze data on UFO sightings using one date filter. Dana tasked with updating the webpage to provide multiple filter critera that will allow for a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings.

## Results
You can filter for specific attributes within the table. See below for examples and explanations

### Enter a Shape
In order to filter on a specific shape, click in the white input box labeled "Enter a Shape" and type "light". The data will return all UFO sightings that are filtered for light shape.

## Summary
There is a vast accounts of UFO sightings across the Contigious United States and Canada.

* One Drawback of the webpage: As data grows it might be more difficult to see trends to provide a more in-depth analysis over UFO sightings.

* Recommendation One: Add a heatmap to show where a majority of the sightings were found.
* Recommendation Two: Include a line graph that shows number of sightings for each date.
